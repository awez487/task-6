# Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
* Password should be at least 12 characters
* Mix letters (upper + lower), numbers, and symbols
* Avoid common words or patterns (like 123, password)
* Use random characters or passphrases

# Tips Learned
Use passphrases like Sun!Shine@Ocean2025
Don’t reuse passwords
Use a password manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password)
Don’t use names, birthdays, or "password123"
Change passwords regularly

# Research Common Password Attacks
* Brute Force – attacker tries every possible combo (slow but works if the password is short/simple)
* Dictionary Attack – uses common word lists (like "admin", "123456", "qwerty")
* Most common password can be cracked easily by using this Tools
  
# Summarize Password Complexity
Password complexity means how difficult a password is to guess or crack. It depends on:
Length (more characters = better).
Character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
Randomness (less predictable = better).
Uniqueness (not reused or common).
